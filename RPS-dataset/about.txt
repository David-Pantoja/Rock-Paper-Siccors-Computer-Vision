The CSVs hold labeled images where 0 is rock, 1 is paper, and 2 is scissors.

The pixel values are in gray scale (Main.py also only deals with grayscale images)

Originally from https://www.kaggle.com/datamunge/sign-language-mnist?select=sign_mnist_test where I converted some ASL letters to RPS object.
	0 = "A" = "ROCK", 1 = "B" = "PAPER", 21 = "V" = "SCISSORS"
