# Rock-Paper-Siccors-Computer-Vision

Heavily annotared main.py to make understanding computer vision a little easier

This uses an American Sign Language dataset I used to substitute for Rock Paper and Scissors where a=rock, b=paper, and v=scissors so when testing accuracy keep that in mind.

##Description
